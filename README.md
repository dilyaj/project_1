###The Game###
Truth or Drink can be played by 2 players.
Take turns getting a random question/
The other player then chooses to answer the question and gain 20 points, or drink and get 10 points per round.
**The player that reaches 100 points first, wins. The other loses.**

###Technologies Used:###
HTML<br>
CSS: modals, flex, gif<br>
JavaScript: DOM, Classes, functions, event listeners, conditionals<br>

###Lessons/Ongoing Issues:###
I learned to stop overcomplicating things. Especially with using the Fisher-Yates shuffle. The more simple, the better.
